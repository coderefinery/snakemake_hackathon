# Hackathon

This time is reserved for you. You can start implementing your own workflow with Snakemake, move your existing workflow to a cluster or follow any of our toy examples, based on interest.

If you have not used Snakemake before, we recommend to start on your laptop and follow the [CodeRefinery Snakemake demo](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/workflow-management/#a-demo) instructions to create your first workflow and run it on your laptop (Installation: [Snakemake installation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)) or within an interactive job on your cluster (resource needs are minimal, 2GB of memory and one core should more than suffice).

You can also use the CodeRefinery example as a base and try and run it on a cluster as batch job or with Hyperqueue instead.

If you want to try out Hyperqueue, we suggest to follow the [Hyperqueue example](./Hyperqueue_example.md).
